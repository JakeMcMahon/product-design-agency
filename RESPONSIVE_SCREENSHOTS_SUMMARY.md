## Key Observations

1. **Desktop Performance**: Both MacBook sizes show all sections properly with good layout and spacing.

2. **Tablet Performance**: Most content displays correctly, but the pricing section appears to be positioned off-screen, requiring scrolling to access.

3. **Mobile Performance**: Timeline and stats sections are visible, but pricing section is inaccessible without significant scrolling. Navigation elements may have overflow issues.

4. **Missing Elements**: The footer section was not detected on any device size, suggesting it may be hidden or not properly structured.

## Recommendations

1. **Pricing Section**: Implement responsive design to ensure the pricing section is visible within the initial viewport on tablet and mobile devices.

2. **Footer Visibility**: Investigate why the footer is not being detected and ensure it's properly displayed on all devices.

3. **Navigation Optimization**: Implement a mobile-friendly navigation system (e.g., hamburger menu) for smaller screens.
