## Device-by-Device Analysis

### iPhone SE (375x667)
**Analysis of Sections 1-10:**

*   **Section 1 (Hero):** A **Major** issue is present where the main CTA button ("Посмотреть, как мы автоматизируем") is cut off on the right. The header logo is also slightly truncated (**Minor** issue). This suggests a fixed-width element is overflowing its container.
*   **Section 2 (Timeline):** Confirms the **Critical** Z-index bug where the section title is completely obscured by the cards below it.
*   **Section 4 (Stats):** Confirms the **Major** `line-height` issue. Descriptive text within the cards is compressed to the point of overlapping, making it illegible.
*   **Section 5 (Video Sales Letter):** A **Major** layout failure. The text content to the right of the video is severely cut off, indicating a rigid multi-column layout that does not adapt to a single column on mobile.
*   **Sections 7, 8, 9 (Testimonials):** All three testimonial cards exhibit a **Major** layout issue where statistical labels (e.g., "Автоматизация процессов") and their values (e.g., "95%") overlap, making the data unreadable.
*   **Section 10 (CTA):** The "Посмотреть цены" button is cut off on the right, another **Major** fixed-width issue.

**Analysis of Sections 11-20:**

*   **Sections 11-18:** These sections are completely blank, revealing a **Major** layout issue where excessive empty space exists between content blocks, creating a broken user experience.
*   **Section 19 ('Real price' cards):** A **Major** layout break. A 2x2 grid of cards overflows the screen and overlaps, making the content on the right unreadable.
*   **Section 20 (Pricing Section Start):** This section confirms that the pricing content is missing, as only the section's decorative image is visible.

**Analysis of Sections 21-30:**

*   **Sections 21-27 (Pricing):** This section now appears on mobile but is not responsive, causing a **Critical** horizontal overflow. The entire multi-card layout is wider than the screen, requiring horizontal scrolling to view content.
*   **Section 29 (Team Stats):** A **Major** issue where a 2x2 grid of stats is not responsive. It does not stack vertically, causing the right-side elements to be cut off.
*   **Section 30 (Founder Bio):** The founder's bio card is cut off on the right side, making the text unreadable (**Major** issue).

**Analysis of Sections 31-40:**

*   **Section 31 (Founder Bio):** The bio card for the second founder is also cut off on the right (**Major** issue).
*   **Sections 32-34 (Expertise List):** The text content in this list is consistently cut off on the right side (**Major** issue).
*   **Sections 35-38 (Process Timeline):** This entire component is broken. It appears to be a non-responsive horizontal timeline where cards overlap and content is hidden, making the process steps unreadable. This is a **Critical** usability failure.
*   **Sections 39-40 (Approach Comparison):** The content within these cards is extremely cramped, with numbers and labels squashed together, indicating poor spacing on mobile (**Major** issue).

**Analysis of Sections 41-50:**

*   **Section 41 (Approach Comparison):** Continues the **Major** issue of cramped content from the previous batch.
*   **Sections 42-48 (Benefits Timeline):** This component is well-structured and responsive. No issues found here.
*   **Section 49 (Testimonials Header):** The paragraph text is cut off on the right side due to a fixed-width container (**Major** issue).
*   **Section 50:** This blank section indicates the continuation of the **Major** empty space issue.

**Analysis of Sections 51-60:**

*   **Sections 51-56 (New Pricing Section):** This batch reveals a *second*, completely different pricing section that, unlike the first one, **is fully responsive**. The cards stack correctly and all content is readable. This indicates a major inconsistency in the codebase.
*   **Sections 57-60 (Resources Section):** The cards for the free resources are also well-built and responsive. No issues found here.

**Analysis of Sections 61-70:**

*   **Sections 61-63 (Free Audit):** This section is not responsive. Stats at the top are cramped and the main CTA button is cut off on the right (**Major** issue).
*   **Sections 64-68 (New Founder Bios):** This reveals a *second*, responsive version of the founder bio section. Unlike the broken version in sections 30-31, this one is well-formatted for mobile.
*   **Sections 69-70 (Why we created...):** The CTA button at the bottom of this section is cut off on the right (**Major** issue).

**Analysis of Sections 71-81:**

*   **Sections 71-73 (FAQ):** The FAQ section uses an accordion that is well-formatted and responsive. No issues found.
*   **Sections 74-81 (Footer):** The footer is completely broken, which is a **Critical** issue. It uses a multi-column desktop layout that is not adapted for mobile, causing content to overlap and overflow the screen, making it unusable.

## Issue Catalog

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- **Footer (iPhone SE, Sections 74-81):** The entire footer is broken and unusable on mobile due to a non-responsive multi-column layout.
- **Process Timeline (iPhone SE, Sections 35-38):** The entire process timeline component is broken and unreadable due to overlapping cards and horizontal overflow.
