## What Was Fixed

### 1. String Escaping Issues
The primary issue was multiline strings in the `problemStatements` array that were not properly escaped:

**Before (causing errors):**
```typescript
description:
  "You have a business. You know that product design can transform everything. But every specialist quotes millions and timelines in years. Every solution seems critical. You're paralyzed by choice - Should I build a mobile app or web app? Which tech stack to choose?

*We've guided 50+ companies through this maze. Our free audit gives you a clear roadmap in 48 hours.*",
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
description:
  "You have a business. You know that product design can transform everything. But every specialist quotes millions and timelines in years. Every solution seems critical. You're paralyzed by choice - Should I build a mobile app or web app? Which tech stack to choose?\n\n*We've guided 50+ companies through this maze. Our free audit gives you a clear roadmap in 48 hours.*",
```

### 2. All Problem Statements Updated
All 6 problem statements in the SectionWrapper.tsx file have been properly formatted:
1. "ðŸ¤¯ I HAVE AN IDEA BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START"
2. "ðŸ’¸ SPENDING MONEY ON IT BUT SEEING NO RESULTS"
3. "ðŸ˜° DEVELOPERS DISAPPEARED WITH MY PRODUCT"
4. "ðŸŽ¯ LAUNCHED MY PRODUCT BUT NO ONE IS USING IT"
5. "ðŸ”„ STUCK IN ENDLESS REVISIONS"
6. "ðŸ¤– EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT DESIGN BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW"
