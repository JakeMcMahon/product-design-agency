# Video Sales Letter Script: AI Automation That Actually Works

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Tone:** Conversational, expert, anti-hype  
**Target:** Business leaders drowning in AI noise who need practical solutions

---

## HOOK (0-15 seconds)

**[Scene: Jake on camera, confident but not overly polished]**

"If you're a business leader who's tired of AI promises that never deliver actual results... if you've seen your competitors throw money at 'revolutionary AI agents' only to watch them fail spectacularly... then this might be the most important video you watch this year."

**[Pause for emphasis]**

"Because I'm about to show you why 80% of AI projects fail, and more importantly, the five proven patterns that the other 20% use to generate millions in ROI."

---

## PROBLEM AGITATION (15-45 seconds)

**[Scene: Transition to screen recording showing confusing AI dashboards/interfaces]**

"Here's what's happening in boardrooms everywhere: Executives are getting pitched on 'autonomous AI agents' and 'revolutionary machine learning platforms' that promise to transform their business overnight."

**[Back to Jake]**

"But here's the uncomfortable truth - these complex systems fail because companies are building what's trendy, not what actually solves their problems."

"I'm Jake McMahon. I've spent 8 years transforming SaaS companies from data chaos to growth engines. And I've seen this pattern over and over: businesses chase the latest AI hype instead of focusing on what their users actually need."

---

## CREDIBILITY & SOLUTION PREVIEW (45-75 seconds)

**[Scene: Show brief case study graphics - percentages, before/after charts]**

"Working with my research partner Vyacheslav Разин from ННГУ, we've implemented AI solutions for 200+ companies. Not the kind that look impressive in demos but fail in production - the kind that deliver 72% cost reductions and 30% productivity gains."

"The secret? We approach AI like product strategists, not tech vendors. We use Jobs-to-be-Done methodology to understand what work your users are actually trying to accomplish."

**[Pause]**

"And we've discovered that every successful AI implementation uses one of just five core patterns. Master these patterns, and you'll understand 95% of what actually works with AI today."

---

## PATTERN PREVIEW (75-105 seconds)

**[Scene: Simple visual showing the 5 patterns - icons or basic graphics]**

"These aren't theoretical frameworks - they're battle-tested patterns:

Pattern 1: Single Prompt - for when you need quick, focused AI responses
Pattern 2: Prompt Chaining - for complex, multi-step workflows  
Pattern 3: Routing - for smart cost optimization and handling different request types
Pattern 4: Parallel Processing - for critical decisions requiring multiple perspectives
Pattern 5: Agentic Systems - for dynamic, goal-oriented automation

But here's what matters most: choosing the RIGHT pattern for YOUR specific business problem."

---

## TRANSFORMATION STORY (105-135 seconds)

**[Scene: Case study visual or customer logo]**

"Let me give you a real example. We worked with a SaaS company that was drowning in support tickets. Their first instinct? Build a complex AI agent that could handle everything automatically.

Instead, we started simple. We implemented a single prompt pattern that drafts initial responses for support agents to review and send. 

Result? 64% reduction in response time. No complex agent. No autonomous system. Just the right pattern applied to the right job-to-be-done."

**[Back to Jake]**

"That's the difference between AI that works and AI that wastes money - understanding the job your users are trying to get done, then choosing the simplest pattern that accomplishes it."

---

## SOCIAL PROOF & RESULTS (135-165 seconds)

**[Scene: Results graphics, client logos if available]**

"This approach has helped our clients achieve:
- 72% cost reduction with simple routing patterns
- 95% client retention because our solutions actually work
- $100M+ in operational savings across our client base

Companies like [specific industry examples] are using these patterns right now to automate processes that used to take hours, turning them into minutes of work."

"But here's what I want you to understand - this isn't about the technology. It's about strategy. It's about understanding your business deeply enough to build AI that serves your actual goals, not just impresses people in meetings."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING (165-180 seconds)

**[Scene: Jake addressing camera directly]**

"Now, you might be thinking 'But Jake, shouldn't we be building more sophisticated AI? What about all these autonomous agents everyone's talking about?'

Here's the truth: the companies getting real results from AI start with patterns that work, then evolve based on data. They don't start with the most complex solution - they start with what solves the job-to-be-done."

---

## URGENCY & CTA (180-210 seconds)

**[Scene: Jake, more urgent but not pushy]**

"Look, while your competitors are burning cash on AI projects that never deliver, you have a choice. You can keep waiting for the 'perfect' AI solution, or you can start implementing patterns that work today.

I've created a comprehensive guide called 'The 5 LLM Automation Patterns Every Business Needs to Know' - it's the same framework we use with our clients who are seeing 30% productivity gains.

In this guide, you'll get the exact decision framework for choosing the right pattern, real implementation examples, and a step-by-step roadmap from simple automation to sophisticated systems that actually deliver ROI."

---

## FINAL CTA (210-240 seconds)

**[Scene: Strong, direct to camera]**

"This isn't another theoretical AI framework. It's a practical guide based on what actually works in production with real businesses generating real results.

Click the button below to download your free copy. Learn the patterns. Apply them to your business. Start building AI that actually works.

Because data without action is just pretty charts. And AI without results is just expensive technology."

**[Pause]**

"Get your guide now, and let's turn your AI investments into measurable business impact."
