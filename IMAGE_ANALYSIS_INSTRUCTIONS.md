## Phase 1: Individual Device Analysis

For each device size, analyze the following aspects:

### Visual Layout Assessment
1. Check for proper alignment and spacing of elements
2. Identify any overlapping or truncated content
3. Evaluate white space distribution
4. Assess grid system consistency

### Typography Review
1. Check font sizes for readability
2. Evaluate line heights and paragraph spacing
3. Identify any text overflow or truncation
4. Assess contrast ratios for accessibility

### Navigation Analysis
1. Examine header/navigation bar layout
2. Check menu item visibility and spacing
3. Identify any navigation overflow issues
4. Assess mobile menu functionality (if applicable)

### Content Section Review
1. Timeline cards - Check layout, spacing, and content visibility
2. Stats cards - Evaluate data presentation and visual hierarchy
3. Pricing cards - Assess plan comparison and call-to-action visibility
4. Footer - Check link visibility and contact information display

### Image and Media Assessment
1. Evaluate image sizing and aspect ratios
2. Check for pixelation or distortion
3. Assess media placement and responsiveness

## Phase 2: Cross-Device Comparison

Compare each device size against the others to identify:

### Layout Consistency
1. Check for consistent spacing and alignment across devices
2. Identify elements that break visual hierarchy
3. Note any missing sections on smaller screens

### Content Visibility
1. Verify all critical content is accessible on all devices
2. Identify content that becomes hidden or truncated
3. Check for proper content prioritization

### Interactive Elements
1. Assess button sizing for touch targets
2. Evaluate form field usability
3. Check link visibility and spacing

### Visual Design Continuity
1. Verify consistent color schemes
2. Check brand element consistency
3. Assess iconography and imagery quality

## Phase 3: Issue Categorization

Organize findings into these categories:

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Content inaccessible or missing
- Navigation broken or unusable
- Text illegible or truncated
- Critical functionality broken

### Major Issues (Should Fix)
- Layout inconsistencies
- Visual hierarchy problems
- Poor spacing or alignment
- Accessibility concerns

### Minor Issues (Nice to Improve)
- Visual polish opportunities
- Micro-interaction enhancements
- Typography refinements
- Color contrast improvements

## Phase 4: Technical Recommendations

For each identified issue, provide:
1. Specific problem description
2. Affected device sizes
3. Technical solution recommendation
4. Priority level (High/Medium/Low)

## Reporting Format

Create a comprehensive report with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Methodology
3. Device-by-Device Analysis
4. Cross-Device Comparison
5. Issue Catalog with Prioritization
6. Technical Recommendations
7. Conclusion

Include specific examples with references to screenshot files when describing issues.
