## Technical Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. Development Server Errors
During the transformation process, the Vite development server experienced critical errors:

#### Error Details:
```
[plugin:vite:react-swc] x Unterminated string constant
[plugin:vite:react-swc] x Expected unicode escape
```

#### Root Cause:
The transformation process introduced malformed escape sequences in TypeScript files, particularly in string literals containing newline characters. Files were corrupted with double-escaped quotes (`\\"` instead of `"`).

### 2. Issues Successfully Resolved
All technical issues have been successfully addressed:

1. **Systematic File Audit**: Reviewed all `.tsx` files for improper escape sequences
2. **Escape Sequence Correction**: Replaced all double-escaped quotes (`\\"`) with proper quotes (`"`)
3. **Syntax Validation**: Ensured all arrays and objects have proper syntax
4. **Server Restart**: Successfully restarted the development server

### 3. Verification
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- Development server running on port 8080
- Website fully accessible and functional
